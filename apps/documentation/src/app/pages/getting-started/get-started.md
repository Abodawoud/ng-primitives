# Get Started

## Installation

Angular Primitives is distributed as a single package with entrypoints for each primitive.
This makes it easy to install and update, while keeping the bundle size as small as possible.

To install Angular Primitives, run the following command:

```bash npm
npm i @ng-primitives/ng-primitives
```
