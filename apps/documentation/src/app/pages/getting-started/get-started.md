# Get Started

## Installation

Angular Primitives is distributed as a single package with entrypoints for each primitive.
This makes it easy to install and update, while keeping the bundle size as small as possible.

To install Angular Primitives, run the following command:

```bash npm
npm i ng-primitives
```

## Peer Dependencies

Angular Primitives relies on a few peer dependencies that need to be installed. If you are using NPM version 7 or higher, these dependencies will be installed automatically. If you are using an older version of NPM, or a different package manager, you may need to install them manually.

| Package          | Version  |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| @angular/cdk     | >=18.0.0 |
| @floating-ui/dom | >=1.6.0  |

To install these dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm i @angular/cdk@^18.0.0 @floating-ui/dom@^1.6.0
```
