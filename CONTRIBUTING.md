# Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, there are many ways to get involved. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

- **Report a bug**: If you find a bug in the library, please open an issue on GitHub. Be sure to include a detailed description of the bug, steps to reproduce, and any relevant code snippets.
- **Request a feature**: If you have an idea for a new feature or enhancement, please open an issue on GitHub. Be sure to include a detailed description of the feature, use cases, and any relevant code snippets.
- **Submit a pull request**: If you'd like to contribute code to the library, please open a pull request on GitHub. Be sure to include a detailed description of the changes, any relevant issue numbers, and any relevant code snippets.
- **Improve the documentation**: Documentation is a critical part of any library. If you'd like to help improve the library's documentation, please open a pull request on GitHub.
- **Spread the word**: If you enjoy using the library, please consider sharing it with others. The more people who use the library, the more feedback we'll receive, and the better the library will become.

## Requesting a new feature

While we draw inspiration from the libraries like Radix UI, Headless UI and React Aria we are not looking to port their features as-is.
We want to develop a feature in whatever way is best for Angular.

If you wish to develop a feature, please raise an issue or discussion first to discuss the feature and how it fits into the library.
We don't want you to spend time developing a feature that we may not be able to accept.

## Submitting a pull request

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following steps are completed:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes and ensure the tests pass.
3. Update the documentation if necessary.
4. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of the changes.
