# Angular Primitives

Angular Primitives is a low-level UI component library with a focus on accessibility, customization, and developer experience. Whether you're building a design system from scratch or looking to enhance your existing one, our primitives are here to support you every step of the way.

The library is very much in the early stages of development, expect breaking changes while we refine our API.
