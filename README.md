# Angular Primitives

Angular Primitives is a low-level UI component library with a focus on accessibility, customization, and developer experience. Whether you're building a design system from scratch or looking to enhance your existing one, our primitives are here to support you every step of the way.

You can find our [documentation site here](https://ng-primitives.github.io/ng-primitives).

The library is very much in the early stages of development, expect breaking changes while we refine our API.

## Installation

npm install @ng-primitives/ng-primitives
